# A11y Keyboard

An accessibility keyboard (work in progress).

Accessibility (a11y) is a quality of software allowing disabled people to access the same information and user experience as those without disabilities.
This application provides a quick and intuitive way to communicate for those with disabilities. It isn't meant to replace devices' built-in accessibility tools, but helps to bridge the gap left by the steep learning curve for things like screen readers and text-to-speech software.

Originally developed to help those who suffer from aggressive forms of palsy, this web app targets limited motor and verbal ability. With some work, it could move toward more of a framework for building custom keyboards that target specific sets of disabilities, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
